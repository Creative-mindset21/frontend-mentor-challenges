    Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not
    suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI
    outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to
    use. Gender The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary
    with age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered when
    evaluating their BMI. Age In aging individuals, increased body fat and
    muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate body fat content. Muscle BMI may
    misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't
    differentiate muscle from fat. Pregnancy Expectant mothers experience weight
    gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is
    advisable to minimise health risks for both mother and child. Race Certain
    health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at
    lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with
    your GP or practice nurse.
